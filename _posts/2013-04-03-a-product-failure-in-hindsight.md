<p>
A fews years ago I built and launched a SAAS product. It made $15. In retrospect though, it was not as much of a failure as I originally thought.
</p>

<h2>Early Marketing</h2>
<p>
Agent Showroom was a way for Realtors to automatically put their MLS listings on Facebook. My target market was Realtors that used Facebook for their business.
I made a list of Realtors who had Facebook fanpages and spent my mornings before work calling each of them. I targetted Realtors on the east coast
so that I could call them early in the morning from the west coast.
</p>
<p>
I made 0 sales. It turns out that Realtors are not terribly tech savvy. I had a lot of trouble explaining what my product did, how it worked with Facebook,
and even what a fanpage was. I needed a better way to find qualified customers.
</p>
<p>
I started working with a guy who was better at marketing. He did a couple things that got the product moving. First he wrote and issued a press release.
A local newspaper saw the press release and asked to interview us. We managed to get written about in a couple other small newspapers but that is all
it took.
</p>
<h2>Enterprise "Pivot"</h2>
<p>
Our minor amount of press got us a phone call from one of the larger MLSs. The meeting went well. The MLSs was very interested in our product. We 
scheduled a followup meeting and we were very excited for our first enterprise sale.
</p>
<p>
We were able get phone calls with 5 other MLSs in the United States and Canada with only cold emails (and name drops to who we were working with).
3 out of 5 of the initial phone calls wanted a follow up. The other 2 were not a distinct 'no', but they were hesitent to be one of our first customers. 
</p>
<h2>Coffee is for Closers</h2>
<p>
And we didn't close. Follow-up conversations were directionless. All parties wanted to make the sale but it seemed like there was always something (or someone) 
in the way. We prematurely lost interest in pursueing what seemed like flakey customers. We spent our efforts on funnel marketing
directly to Realtors which seemed more glamorous to us although we never had any success.
</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
Our failure was our impatience with the enterprise sales process. We failed to direct the conversation of followup meetings. We failed to make it easy
for our advocates inside the enterprise to sell us to their coworkers and bosses. We failed to create a repeatable sales strategy. We expected the customer
to do all this for us and decided that enterprise customers were flakey and not worth persueing.
</p>
<p>
Our biggest failure was our expectation that an enterprise sale would happen in 1 meeting. We wanted to present our product and collect money. We did not understand
that an enterprise sale is a slow grind not a snap decision.
