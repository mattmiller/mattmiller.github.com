tl;dr: Be confident and control the direction of the interview with a relavent resume and interesting project history

# Be Confident

The most common reason I to dismiss a candidate is because he/she lacks confidence. Confidence is not a requirement to be a software developer, but it is very hard to prove that a candidate is smart if the candidate is lacking confidence in the interview. 

Interviewing is difficult and can be humbling. A lot of people are unable to come out of their shells within 45 minutes of meeting someone in an interview environment. Very often I attempt to interview candidates who are shy and difficult to converse with. If no dialogue emerges quickly the interview will degrade into a series of fizz/buzz like programming questions. These are usually difficult (especially for a newgrad/junior dev) and getting a question wrong further erodes the candidates confidence.

This style of interview accidentally weeds out good candidates. As an interviewer I am shooting in the dark with programming questions. I hope that you will be able to answer them, but most newgrad/junior devs cannot. If I get through my 45 mintues and I haven't asked enough of the right questions of a candidate for him to prove he is smart enough to hire I can't recommend him.

# Controlling the Direction of the Interview

How do you as a interviewee be confident enough to have an interesting dialogue with an interviewer? List things that you are good at and interested in on your resume. Interesting projects listed promenantly on the resume will direct the interviewer to ask about them. 

I love asking interviewees about their projects. People come to life when they talk about something they enjoyed, worked hard on, and can teach me about. This is the best way to force an interesting dialogue.

This has worked for me on the other side of the table as well. When interviewing straight out of college I listed a photo gallery website I build for my fiance (this was before Flickr). Nearly every interview I had centered around that website. I would tell them the URL, they would click around and ask me questions about how the backend worked, how I uploaded files, etc... It was easy for me to talk about since it was the one thing I knew more about than they did. And it ate a lot of clock so I did not have time to fail a bubble sort question.
